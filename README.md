# Google Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks
## Description
The recurrent networks such as RNN, LSTM and GRU are implemented to predict the short-term and long-term stock price of Google.

## Dataset
The Google Stock Price dataset from Kaggle is used for training the models. For more details refer: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulsah06/gooogle-stock-price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulsah06/gooogle-stock-price).

## Code
The models are developed using PyTorch and the code is available in [Assignment 3.ipynb](./Assignment%203.ipynb) file.
